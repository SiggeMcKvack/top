/* The update check: when the home screen opens, one request in the background, never waited for, to GitHub for the
 * latest release published of the public repository (config/version.json's `repository`), whose tag is compared with
 * the running version (config/version.json's `version`); a newer one is offered to the home screen, its version and
 * its page.  update_check=off in settings.txt asks nothing.  A capture, a game --rom starts, the harness and the tests
 * never ask the network: --update-check-url gives them a file (or another address) to read instead.
 *
 * Each platform asks with its own client and the system's TLS, its certificates checked (update_fetch.h). */
