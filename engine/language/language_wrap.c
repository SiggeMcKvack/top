/* The texts laid out again for the compact text: each page filled to a line's pixels in the font's own widths.
 *
 * The game breaks no line: its texts carry their breaks, made for sixteen characters of eight pixels (ROM_DATA_FORMATS,
 * section 8).  The compact text draws a line in the font's widths (oracles_text_place), so that a line of 128 pixels
 * holds more; this layout makes its pages of two lines hold it.  A text is cut into pages where it opens a new box
 * (\stop, \heartpiece): each page is laid out alone, its line breaks becoming spaces and its words put back on its
 * lines from the first, as many as a line holds.  A word broken at a line's end by a hyphen before a small letter
 * ("Vergan-" / "genheit") is joined again, the hyphen dropped, its break kept as a place a line may end at, hyphen
 * shown, in German and Italian, which break their words so; in English, French and Spanish, whose hyphens at a line's
 * end are their compounds' ("lava-" / "like", "grand-" / "chose"), only a word the language writes whole elsewhere
 * ("some-" / "thing"), or neither of whose parts it writes alone ("appara-" / "tront"), or one of the few closed compounds
 * of English the games break so ("after-" / "life").  A hyphen before a capital, or one the language writes inside a line in the same word
 * (language_wrap_learn), is a word's own, kept.  A line is measured as the transaction draws it: a name (\Link, \Child) as five of the widest
 * letters a name may hold, a number (\num1, \num2) as three of the widest digits, a symbol on its whole tile, the colours
 * as \col sets them, from either attribute a box opens with ($80 or $81, TEXTBOXFLAG_ALTPALETTE1), a tile holding one.
 *
 * A page is left as it is when it lays out a choice (\opt) or a secret, calls another text (\call), shows the piece of
 * heart, or aligns its lines with spaces (a line that starts with a space, two spaces in a row, an empty line); a text
 * is left whole as it is when it shows a single box, and from its first \jump or cmd8 on, what follows being another
 * text's.  A text laid out again must give the same commands as before (oracles_text_same_commands), the same characters
 * but its spaces, breaks and the hyphens of the words it joined, every line within the width and no break before its end nor empty line the
 * layout made (a page kept as it is keeps its own); one that does not keeps its layout. */
