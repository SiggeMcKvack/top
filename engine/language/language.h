/* The official translations of Ages and Seasons, played on the US ROM.
 *
 * The user's European ROM of a game holds its texts in English, French,
 * German, Italian and Spanish, under the identifiers (TX_GGII) of the US
 * texts, in the same format, and a font with the glyphs they need.  A pack is
 * extracted from it once (language_extract.c): per language, its English
 * included (English (EU), the European edition's), a text for each
 * US text, the glyphs of the European font that differ from the US one, and
 * the graphics that carry text (language_gfx.c).  A language is then composed
 * into the image the core runs (language_compose.c): the texts in banks of the
 * extension the game never reads, an index of them, the glyphs written over
 * the US font, and the graphics where the US ones were, their headers
 * repointed; the guest serves the index at the
 * return of getTextAddress (guest.h, oracles_guest_arm_language).  The game
 * lays out, pages and prints a European text as it does its own.
 *
 * A US text takes the European text of its identifier when its commands are
 * the US text's (oracles_text_same_commands); else what the game's table of
 * exceptions (config/language_exceptions_*.tsv, language_table.c) names: the
 * European text of another identifier, where the European ROM moved it; the
 * European text adapted to the US code by a rule (language_rules.c), at
 * extraction, on the user's machine; the port's own, unofficial translation
 * (config/language_own.tsv); or the US English.  Every text so made is checked
 * against the US text's commands and lines; one that fails stays in English. */
