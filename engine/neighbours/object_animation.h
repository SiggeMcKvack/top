/* An object's animation, advanced from the game's data (docs/GAME_HOOKS.md,
 * section 4.2).
 *
 * The game animates an interaction, an enemy or a part by the same routine
 * of bank 0 (interactionAnimate, enemyAnimate, partAnimate): animCounter is
 * counted down, and when it runs out _xxxNextAnimationFrame reads at
 * animPointer three bytes of the bank of the kind's animation table: the
 * frames to hold the next pose (or $ff then an offset, which loops back
 * once), the pose's index, and animParameter; animPointer moves past them,
 * and oamDataAddress takes the block that index names in the kind's OAM data
 * table for the object's id (its two high bits cut, $40 added for an
 * interaction and a part).  The object's own code calls it, once or more a
 * frame, and chooses the animation (xxxSetAnimation): the choice is not
 * followed here.
 *
 * A neighbour's objects are captured frozen; their animation is advanced
 * here, by a deliberate exception that relaxes, for this step alone, the
 * rule of no game logic reimplemented, the way the tiles' animation and the
 * objects' sprites relax it.  The harness proves it against the objects the
 * live game animates (--object-animation-check). */
