#   linux_release_check BUILD_DIR       checks the build and patchelf, and sets version (config/version.json's) and
#                                       arch, the machine in the files' names: x86_64 or arm64 (uname -m's aarch64)
#   linux_release_files BUILD_DIR DIR   puts in DIR the-oracles-project with the libSDL3.so.0 it loads beside it (its
#                                       run path is $ORIGIN), the licences of what it embeds and a README.txt
#
# BUILD_DIR is a build configured with -DORACLES_SDL3_FROM_SOURCE=ON (the SDL 3 pinned in config/sdl3.json, built
# with the engine, rather than the system's) and whose target oracles is built.
