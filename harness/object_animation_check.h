/* The check of the objects' animation the host advances
 * (object_animation.h) against the live game, which animates the objects of
 * its room by the same data.
 *
 * At every return of updateAllObjects in normal play, each object a
 * neighbour would show (numbered, not placed at random, drawn, of a kind
 * whose tables are known) is judged: one call of the host's step from its
 * state at the last update must give its state now.  What the game did
 * otherwise is told apart: no call (its code did not animate it), several,
 * an animation its code chose, a pose its code wrote, or anything else.
 * The pose changes the step predicts are counted against those the game
 * shows on the same update, for the objects a neighbour animates by the rule
 * on their capture (oracles_object_animation_animated, the capture's probe):
 * none may be wrong while Link has not come near the object, as in a
 * neighbour.  The objects the rule keeps in their captured pose, and those
 * no capture paired, are counted apart; the probe's verdict is held against
 * the game's first updates after the scroll.
 *
 * Each room entered by a scrolling transition is also captured as a
 * neighbour is (the ghost, objects frozen): the poses of each captured
 * object's loop, read from the ROM, and for each pose the live object shows,
 * its tiles in the capture against the live VRAM's; the state the capture
 * holds against the object's when the game animates it first; and the cost
 * of a pose's redraw, timed on the capture with the software PPU. */
